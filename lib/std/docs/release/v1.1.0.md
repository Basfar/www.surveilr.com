# `surveilr` v1.1.0 Release Notes ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸš€ New Features

### 1. **Integrated Documentation in Web UI**

This release introduces a comprehensive update to the RSSD Web UI, allowing users to access and view all `surveilr`-related SQLite functions, release notes, and internal documentation directly within the interface. This feature enhances user experience by providing integrated, easily navigable documentation without the need to leave the web environment, ensuring that all necessary information is readily available for efficient reference and usage.

### 2. **`uniform_resource` Graph Infrastructure**

The foundational framework for tracking `uniform_resource` content using graph representations has been laid out in this release. This infrastructure allows users to visualize `uniform_resource` data as connected graphs in addition to the traditional relational database structure. To facilitate this, three dedicated viewsâ€”`imap_graph`, `plm_graph`, and `filesystem_graph`â€”have been created. These views provide a structured way to observe and interact with data from different ingestion sources:

- **`imap_graph`**: Represents the graphical relationships for content ingested through IMAP processes, allowing for a visual mapping of email and folder structures.
- **`plm_graph`**: Visualizes content from PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) ingestion, showcasing project and issue-based connections.
- **`filesystem_graph`**: Illustrates file ingestion paths and hierarchies, enabling users to track and manage file-based data more intuitively.

This release marks an important step towards enhancing data tracking capabilities, providing a dual approach of relational and graphical views for better data insights and management.
