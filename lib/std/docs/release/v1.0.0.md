## ðŸš€ New Features

### 1. **Database Migration System**

This release introduces a comprehensive database migration feature that allows smooth and controlled updates to the RSSD structure. Our migration system includes:

- **Structured Notebooks and Cells**: A structured system organizes SQL migration scripts into modular code notebooks, making migration scripts easy to track, audit, and execute as needed.
- **Idempotent vs. Non-Idempotent Handling**: Ensures each migration runs in an optimal and secure manner by tracking cell execution history, allowing for re-execution where safe.
- **Automated State Tracking**: All state changes are logged for complete auditing, showing timestamps, transition details, and the results of each migration step.
- **Transactional Execution**: All migrations run within a single transaction block for seamless rollbacks and data consistency.
- **Dynamic Migration Scripts**: Cells marked for migration are dynamically added to the migration script, reducing manual effort and risk of errors.

This system ensures safe, controlled migration of database changes, enhancing reliability and traceability for every update.

### 2. **Enhanced Default Command and Web UI Launch**

The surveilr executable now starts the Web UI as the default command when no specific CLI commands are passed. This feature aims to enhance accessibility and ease of use for new users and teams. Hereâ€™s what happens by default:

- **Automatic Web UI Startup**: By default, running surveilr without additional commands launches the surveilr Web UI.
- **Auto-Browser Launch**: Opens the default browser on the workstation, pointing to the Web UIâ€™s URL and port, providing a user-friendly experience right from the first run.
