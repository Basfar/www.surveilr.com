### New Features

#### 1. `surveilr_ingest_session_id` Scalar Function
The `surveilr_ingest_session_id` function is now available, offering robust management of ingestion sessions. This function ensures efficient session handling by:
- Reusing existing session IDs for devices with active sessions.
- Creating new ingestion sessions when none exist.
- Associating sessions with metadata for improved traceability.


#### 2. `surveilr_udi_dal_fs` Virtual Table Function
The `surveilr_udi_dal_fs` virtual table function provides seamless access to file system resources directly within your SQL queries. With this feature, you can:
- Query file metadata, such as names, paths, sizes, and timestamps.
- Retrieve file content and calculate digests for integrity checks.
- Traverse directories recursively to handle large and nested file systems effortlessly.
